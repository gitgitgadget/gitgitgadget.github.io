		<h1>GitGitGadget - send GitHub PRs to the Git mailing list</h1>

		This project intends to help submit patch series to the Git mailing list. The process is not quite as painless for the contributor as opening Pull Requests, but at least it is much less painful than having to perform all the steps manually (see e.g. [Git for Windows' detailed instructions how to contribute patches to the Git project](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

		GitGitGadget's idea is for users to open a Pull Request at https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git with a good description of their patch series. Then, the command `/submit`, issued via a comment on said PR will tell GitGitGadget to send the patches as mail thread to [the Git mailing list](mailto:git@vger.kernel.org), with the Pull Request's description as cover letter.

		In the case that a reviewer asked for changes, subsequent iterations of the patch series can be sent by force-pushing, possibly updating the description of the Pull Request (including changes relative to the previous iteration), and issuing another `/submit`.

		GitGitGadget itself is a web application written in Typescript (which is really easy to understand/write for everybody who knows even a little Javascript), maintained at https://github.com/gitgitgadget/gitgitgadget.
